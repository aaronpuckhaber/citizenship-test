# citizenship-test

This project used PHP to create a citizenship test that would ask users questions, prompt them to respond with a string, scan their responses, and determine if their answer was correct or incorrect.

As the program grades user's responses, it is not concerned with capitalization. It scans the user's response for a certain string or one of several possible strings, and if it finds it, it will determine that the answer is correct.
